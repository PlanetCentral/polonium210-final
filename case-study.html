                <h2>The Litvinenko Case</h2>
                <div class="textbox">
                    <p>
                        In 2006, Alexander Litvinenko, a former Russian spy, fell victim to a carefully orchestrated
                        assassination involving Polonium-210. He was poisoned by a lethal dose hidden in a cup of tea
                        during a meeting in London, marking the first known case of deliberate radioactive poisoning.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The investigation into Litvinenko’s death revealed traces of Polonium-210 on multiple objects,
                        including airplanes, hotels, and restaurants. The case highlighted the ease with which
                        radioactive substances can be weaponized and raised global concerns about the misuse of nuclear
                        materials.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Litvinenko’s agonizing death underscored the devastating effects of Polonium-210 on human
                        health. His case remains a stark reminder of the importance of stringent security measures to
                        prevent the illegal acquisition and misuse of radioactive elements.
