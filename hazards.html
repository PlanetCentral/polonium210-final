                    <p>
                        Polonium-210 is highly radioactive and poses severe health risks, even in small
                        quantities. Exposure can lead to acute radiation syndrome, which leads to nausea, vomiting,
                        and severe fatigue. If untreated, exposure can result in multi-organ failure and death.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Long-term exposure to low doses of Polonium-210 increases the risk of cancer. Smokers are particularly vulnerable, as low
                        amounts of Polonium-210 are found in tobacco, impacting lung tissue.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The risk of radiation poisoning is highlighted by Polonium-210's ability to accumulate in
                        organs like the liver, spleen, and kidneys, causing irreversible damage. Proper
                        protective measures are key for those working in geo-industries where Polonium-210 is present.
